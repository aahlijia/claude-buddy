/**
 * "Today's whim" — a single optional daily suggestion (game-feel FR-B1/B2).
 *
 * Deliberately NON-COERCIVE: an offer, not an obligation. There is no streak, no
 * consecutive-completion tracking, and no penalty for missing a day — that
 * restraint is structural (there is simply no field to record a miss). The
 * reward for fulfilling it is a single loot roll and nothing more (OQ1).
 *
 * State is account-scoped in whims.json alongside xp.json/streak.json, resolved
 * via buddyStateDir() at call time (honors CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR per profile).
 *
 * Progress is delta-based against the existing event counters (achievements.ts)
 * — no second tally to keep in sync. Whim metrics are global counters only, so
 * the baseline and current readings always come from the same (slot-independent)
 * source.
