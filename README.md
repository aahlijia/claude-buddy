<!-- QUICK START                                                  -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->

## 📋 Requirements

- **[bun](https://bun.sh/install)** on `PATH` — claude-buddy's MCP server runs on bun. Install once: `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash`
- **Claude Code v2.1.80+**
- **Linux or macOS** (Windows is experimental)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1270011/claude-buddy
cd claude-buddy
bun install
bun run install-buddy
```

Then restart Claude Code and type `/buddy`. That's it.

<sub>💡 Want a global `claude-buddy` command? → `bun link`</sub>
<br>
<sub>💡 Need help? → `bun run help` or `claude-buddy help` (if linked) in terminal · `/buddy help` in Claude Code</sub>

### Multiple Claude profiles?

If you run Claude Code with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` set (e.g. separate work and personal accounts), pass the same env var to install so buddy lands in the active profile and gets its own menagerie:

```bash
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-personal bun run install-buddy
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude-personal bun run uninstall
```

The installer prints `Target profile: <path>` at the top so you can see at a glance which profile you're targeting. Each profile gets its own MCP entry, skill, hooks, status line, and `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/buddy-state/` menagerie — installs in one profile don't touch another. With `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` unset, behaviour is identical to single-profile (`~/.claude/`, `~/.claude-buddy/`).

### Rarities

| Rarity | Chance | Stars | Color |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
| Common | 60% | ★ | Gray |
| Uncommon | 25% | ★★ | Green |
| Rare | 10% | ★★★ | Blue |
| Epic | 4% | ★★★★ | Purple |
| Legendary | 1% | ★★★★★ | Gold |

Colors use **24-bit true color** matching Claude Code's dark theme exactly.

### Stats

Every buddy has **5 core stats**: `DEBUGGING` · `PATIENCE` · `CHAOS` · `WISDOM` · `SNARK`

High SNARK buddies are sarcastic. High WISDOM ones are insightful. High CHAOS ones are unpredictable. Each buddy has a peak stat and a dump stat.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎮 &nbsp; Leveling, Mood & Memory</b></summary>

<br>

Your buddy levels up from real coding activity — no separate game to play, no extra commands required during normal use.

### Earning XP

| Event | XP | Trigger |
|---|:---:|---|
| Spotting an error | 12 | Bash output matches an error pattern |
| Test passes | 20 | Bash output matches a test-pass pattern |
| Test fails | 5 | Bash output matches a test-fail pattern |
| Large diff | 20 | A tool edit/write is unusually large |
| Each turn | 1 | Every assistant turn (small, steady trickle) |
| Time spent | 2 / min | Background, while a session is active |
| Petting your buddy | 5 | `/buddy pet` |
| Achievement unlocked | 50 | Any achievement badge earned |
| Session-completion bonus | varies | Computed from the session's commits/tests/diffs at session end |

Rarer buddies earn a small flavor bonus (common ×1.0 → legendary ×1.2) — never a power difference, just a little extra.

### Leveling up

20 levels total. Each level grants **skill points**, spendable via `/buddy upgrades buy <id>` on:

- **Cosmetic unlocks** — bonus eye styles, alternate hats
- **Behavioral unlocks** — new reaction lines that only trigger once purchased
- **Stat unlocks** — small permanent boosts to your buddy's peak stat
- **Prestige titles** (level 11+) — `Committer`, `Debugger`, `Architect`, `Sage`, `Legend`. Equip one with `/buddy upgrades title <id>`; it shows under your buddy's name in the status line.

Respec (refunding unlocks) is open until level 10, then locks permanently — `/buddy upgrades` always shows your current respec status and point balance.

### Mood

Your buddy's mood shifts based on recent test results, error frequency, session length, and time of day. Check it anytime with `/buddy mood`.

### Cross-session memory

Your buddy remembers projects it's seen, recurring bugs, and inferred preferences across sessions — `/buddy memory` to query, `/buddy memory resolve <bug-id>` to mark a bug fixed.

### Stats panel

A live stat-bar panel (`DEBUGGING` / `PATIENCE` / `CHAOS` / `WISDOM` / `SNARK`, with peak ▲ / dump ▼ markers) can render flush-left in the status line, independent of the speech bubble and buddy art. Toggle with `/buddy stats bar [on|off]`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🏆 &nbsp; Endgame Rewards — Prestige · Streaks · Loot · Collection</b></summary>

<br>

Once your buddy is seasoned, a second layer of rewards opens up — all built on top of leveling, all invisible-by-default. Full walkthrough in the [Additional Rewards guide](docs/additional-rewards/additional-rewards-guide.md).

### Prestige / ascension

Hit **level 20** and `/buddy upgrades ascend` resets you to level 1 — but you **keep every unlock, cosmetic, and title**. In return you gain a permanent XP multiplier and access to a prestige-exclusive catalog tier. Repeatable up to **Prestige 5**, with diminishing multiplier gains (×1.05 → ×1.15) so it never becomes power creep. Ascending reopens respec until your next level 10.

### Session streaks

Land a commit session after session and your **streak** grows. Every 3rd consecutive net-positive session pays a milestone bonus (capped well under the session cap — flavor, not a grind). A session that ends with no commit resets the streak. Current and longest streak show in `/buddy xp`.

### Milestone loot boxes

Level-ups, streak milestones, achievements, and ascensions each **roll for loot** — always a small guaranteed skill-point bonus, plus a 12% chance at a loot-exclusive cosmetic you can't buy any other way (rare eye/hat/shiny combos). Loot is always a bonus *on top of* the normal reward, never a replacement.

### Collection milestone

Own one companion of **every rarity tier** (common → legendary) at once and earn an account-wide **Collector** title plus a permanent multiplier — it applies no matter which buddy is active. Progress (`Rarity set: 3/5 — need: epic, legendary`) shows in `/buddy list`.

### Prestige/streak badge

An **opt-in** status-line badge (`P2 🔥7`) under your buddy's name shows prestige tier and current streak. Default off — toggle with `/buddy badge [on|off]`.

### Idle wander

When game-feel intensity is `full`, your buddy quietly **ambles back and forth** along the status line while it's idle — the speech bubble, stats panel, and name stay pinned, only the art drifts. Cosmetic-only motion, no power creep. Default on; toggle with `/buddy wander [on|off]`. Three extra modes are opt-in: `/buddy wander hop` adds a small vertical bob (costs one status-line row), `/buddy wander wide` opens a longer two-sided corridor, and `/buddy wander bubble` makes the speech bubble travel **with** the buddy (the connector stays attached) instead of staying pinned. `/buddy wander status` reports the current settings. The walk only animates at game-feel `full` (`/buddy gamefeel full`), so it stays out of the way for everyone else.

**Motion feels distracting?** Stop the amble with `/buddy wander off`, or dial all the celebratory animation down with `/buddy gamefeel subtle` (brief toasts only) or `/buddy gamefeel off` (silent — the classic status line). Both are read live, no restart needed.

> All multipliers stack multiplicatively but stay modest: rarity (≤×1.20) × prestige (≤×1.15) × collection (×1.05) caps around ×1.45. Every new reward back-fills cleanly onto existing buddies — nothing is lost on upgrade.

<summary><b>🏗️ &nbsp; How It Works</b></summary>

Five integration points, zero binary dependencies. When Claude Code updates, your buddy stays.

```

- **MCP Server** — companion tools + system prompt that instructs Claude to write buddy comments
- **Skill** — routes `/buddy`, `/buddy pet`, `/buddy stats`, `/buddy off`, `/buddy rename`
- **Status Line** — animated ASCII art, right-aligned, with rarity color and speech bubble
- **PostToolUse Hook** — detects errors, test failures, large diffs in Bash output
- **Stop Hook** — extracts invisible `<!-- buddy: ... -->` comments from Claude's responses

### Why MCP Instead of Binary Patching?

| Approach | Survives Updates | Animated | Comments | Risk |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| Binary patching | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | Breaks on update |
| Pin old version | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | No security fixes |
| **claude-buddy** | **✅** | **✅** | **✅** | **None** |

MCP is an industry-standard protocol. Skills are Markdown files. Hooks and status line are shell scripts. Nothing depends on Claude Code's binary internals.

### Repository Layout

```

├── skills/buddy/    # /buddy slash command

### 🎯 Buddy Pick

Want a specific species, rarity, or stat distribution?

```bash
bun run pick
```

Interactive TUI with saved buddies, criteria search, vim keys, and two-pane preview. Uses the exact same `wyhash + mulberry32` algorithm as Claude Code.

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 &nbsp; Diagnostic Tools</b></summary>

<br>

claude-buddy ships with built-in diagnostics for debugging across terminals and platforms.

### `bun run doctor`
Complete diagnostic — environment, terminal info, state, settings, padding test, live status line output. **Always run this first when filing a bug report.**

### `bun run test-statusline`
Temporarily replaces your status line with a multi-line diagnostic. Shows padding strategies side-by-side, color support, Unicode handling.

```bash
bun run test-statusline          # install test
# restart Claude Code, screenshot
bun run test-statusline restore  # restore buddy
```

### `bun run backup`
Snapshot all claude-buddy state to a timestamped backup. Use before experiments.

```bash
bun run backup              # create snapshot
bun run backup list         # list snapshots
bun run backup restore      # restore latest
bun run backup restore <ts> # restore specific
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🐛 &nbsp; Troubleshooting</b></summary>

<br>

### Buddy not appearing in status line

1. Run `bun run doctor` — does the script work directly?
2. Restart Claude Code completely — `instructions` are loaded once at session start
3. Check `~/.claude/settings.json` has the `statusLine` block
4. Make sure `bun` and `jq` are in `$PATH`

### Buddy comments not showing

The buddy comment mechanism uses an MCP server `instructions` field that Claude only reads at **session start**. If you installed claude-buddy in an existing session, restart Claude Code.

```bash
jq '.mcpServers["claude-buddy"]' ~/.claude.json
```

### Buddy art looks broken or misaligned

Known MVP issue on some terminal/platform combos — different terminals render Braille Pattern Blank (U+2800) at different widths.

To help us fix it:
1. Run `bun run doctor` and paste output in a [new issue](https://github.com/1270011/claude-buddy/issues/new)
2. Run `bun run test-statusline` and screenshot the result
3. Then `bun run test-statusline restore`

### Recovery from a broken state

```bash
bun run backup restore      # restore latest backup
bun run cli/uninstall.ts    # full clean removal
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📋 &nbsp; Requirements</b></summary>

<br>

| Requirement | Install |
|---|---|
| **[Bun](https://bun.sh)** | `curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install \| bash` |
| **Claude Code** v2.1.80+ | Any version with MCP support |
| **jq** | `apt install jq` / `brew install jq` / [`windows: download and add 'jq.exe' from jqlang/jq to path`](https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/latest)|

> **Will I get the same buddy I had?** Yes. claude-buddy uses the exact same algorithm as the original (`wyhash + mulberry32`, same salt, same identity resolution). If your `~/.claude.json` still has your `accountUuid`, you'll get the identical species, rarity, stats, and cosmetics.
